I'm a software developer specialising in Node.js along with large portions of experience (and fun) working with React and React Native.

Great lover of [event-driven architectures and open source](https://github.com/jpwilliams/remit). In my extra time I'm either learning Golang, learning Rust, or climbing!

You can find me at [GitHub](https://github.com/jpwilliams), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/atticjack), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackpwilliams/).

_If you'd like to contact me directly, send an email to [jpwilliamsphotography@gmail.com](mailto:jpwilliamsphotography@gmail.com)._
